Slashed is a YHack 2018 Hackathon project created at Yale University.
It is a platform for students to find nearby restaurants that offer discounts. Now it's easier than ever to find a new favorite place to eat, and get together with your friends.
The current version offers information about restaurants in the New Haven area, near Yale, as it is targetted to Yale students.
It is created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using Google Maps API and Google Geolocation API.
